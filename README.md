# Blood-Group-Prediction-Using-Fingerprint-Images
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch to predict blood groups based on fingerprint images. By analyzing unique fingerprint patterns, the model aims to classify a personâ€™s blood group into categories such as A, B, AB, or O, offering a novel approach to biometric-based healthcare solutions.
